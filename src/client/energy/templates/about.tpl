Whether you are a seasoned energy researcher, want to learn more, or support energy efforts on campus, you belong here.  This map was created by the <a href="http://energy.wisc.edu" target="_blank">Wisconsin Energy Institute</a> with the assistence of the <a href="http://dsi.wisc.edu" target="_blank">Data Science Institute</a> to seed energy collaboration across colleges, schools, divisions, departments, and disciplines. Through building these connections, we aim to  strengthen energy research, education and outreach at UW-Madison.</p>
