<p>The <%= defaults.application.name %> is for anyone at UW–Madison who is interested in aging or lifespan-related research, whether you are a seasoned researcher or at the beginning of your career. The map is hosted by the <a href="https://aging.wisc.edu" target="_blank">UW–Madison Institute on Aging (IOA)</a> with the <a href="https://dsi.wisc.edu" target="_blank">UW–Madison Data Science Institute</a> to seed discussion, promote visibility, and encourage collaboration across campus. IOA recognizes that multiple factors interact to influence how people age, so our research is multi-disciplinary. We look at how psychological, social, and behavioral factors interact with biological, neurological, and genetic factors to illuminate who ages well and why, and who does not, and why. We invite you to use this map to build more connections among aging researchers, in order to strengthen aging research, education, and outreach at UW–Madison. </p>
